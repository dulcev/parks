I’ve ran into apps where I can’t see how much battery I have left and it annoys me, so this would be a must have for me.How It Can Be Used:Sometimes when you attend an event, you are too caught up taking videos and pictures, that it’s nice to see how much battery you have left in case you want to make any calls.LINKhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-battery-status/blob/c80ffae72fd1c3ad1b2dada96be79abb7dad8d49/doc/index.mdCaptureWhat it Does:The capture plugin allows you to take photos and video and upload it to the app.How It Can Be Used:Many apps are starting to add video as well and the ones that allow you to record are used a lot more. It’s nice to capture your experience on video too.LINKhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture/blob/5888a627f7c12f17573b2fa9907dc2ce76e44a7a/doc/index.md
